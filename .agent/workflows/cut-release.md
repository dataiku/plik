# Cut a New Release

Walk through the full release checklist: changelog, documentation, commit, PR, tag, and GitHub release.

CRITICAL RULE: NEVER perform any write action on GitHub without explicit user permission. Always present content for review and wait for explicit approval BEFORE publishing anything.

CRITICAL RULE: Explicitly ask for review and confirmation between EACH step. Do NOT proceed to the next step unless the user has confirmed.

## When to Use

- When the user wants to cut a new release (stable or RC)
- Invoked via `/cut-release`

## Steps

### 0. Gather release information

Ask the user:
1. **Version string** — e.g. `1.4`, `1.4.1`, `1.4-RC1`
2. **Release type** — stable release or release candidate (RC)?

Determine:
- If the version contains `-RC` or similar suffix → RC release
- Otherwise → stable/latest release

This distinction matters for:
- Whether to update `README.md` (stable only)
- Docker tagging (`latest` tag is only for stable — see `releaser/release.sh`)

**⏸️ Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### 1. Run security vulnerability checks

Scan for known vulnerabilities in both the Go dependencies and the frontend:

```bash
make vuln
```

This runs:
- **`govulncheck ./...`** — reports Go modules with known CVEs
- **`npm audit`** (in `webapp/`) — checks npm dependencies for known vulnerabilities

Focus on `high` and `critical` severity — `moderate` and below can be noted but are not necessarily release-blockers.

If vulnerabilities are found, present them to the user and discuss whether to fix, bump, or acknowledge before proceeding.

**⏸️ Present the vulnerability scan results. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### 2. Check dependency freshness

Run a dependency audit to identify available updates:

```bash
go list -m -u all 2>&1 | grep '\[v'
```

Categorize the output:
- **Direct dependencies** — listed in `go.mod` with no `// indirect` comment
- **Indirect dependencies** — transitive deps, lower priority

This step is **informational only** — it is not a release blocker. If significant updates are available (especially security-related), discuss with the user whether to address them before the release.

> [!TIP]
> `govulncheck` (from step 1) already flags dependencies with known CVEs. This step complements it by showing all available updates regardless of vulnerability status.

**⏸️ Present the dependency audit summary. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### 3. Check build pipeline versions

Before starting the release, check if newer versions are available for the base images in the `Dockerfile`:

| Image | Current | Check |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `node:<major>-alpine` | `node:24-alpine` | [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) — check for new LTS major |
| `golang:1-bookworm` | Resolves to latest Go 1.x | Run `docker run --rm golang:1-bookworm go version` to see the current Go version |
| `alpine:<version>` | `alpine:3.21` | [Alpine releases](https://alpinelinux.org/releases/) — check for new stable |

Also check:
- `go.mod` Go directive — does it match the Go version from the image?
- Locally installed Go: `go version`

If any updates are available, propose a Dockerfile update and include it in the release commit.

> [!TIP]
> The Go version from this step is needed for the changelog ("Binaries will be built with Go X.Y.Z").

**⏸️ Present findings to the user. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.**

### 4. Review documentation

Verify that documentation is up-to-date with the changes in this release:

1. **README.md** — Check that features, examples, and links are current
2. **User-facing docs (`docs/`)** — Review any doc pages related to changed features
3. **AGENTS.md** — Check that agent instructions reflect current state
4. **ARCHITECTURE.md files** — Verify architecture docs match the codebase

To scope the review, look at what changed since the last release:
```bash
git diff <previous-tag>..HEAD --stat -- docs/ README.md AGENTS.md ARCHITECTURE.md
```

Check if any changes warrant documentation updates:
```bash
git log <previous-tag>..HEAD --oneline
```

**⏸️ Present the documentation review findings to the user. If updates are needed and approved by the user, make them, run `make docs` and wait for approval. If everything is up to date, confirm with the user before proceeding.**

### 5. Generate the changelog

Look at `changelog/` for the format convention of existing entries. The format is:

```
Plik <VERSION>

Hi, today we're releasing <description> !

Here is the changelog :

New :
 - Feature description (#issue)

Fix :
 - Bug fix description (@external_contributor)

Documentation :
 - Doc change description

Binaries will be built with Go <version>

Faithfully,
The plik team
```

To build the changelog:
1. Identify the previous release tag: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
2. List all commits since the last tag: `git log <previous-tag>..HEAD --oneline`
3. Group changes into categories: New, Fix, Documentation, Misc
4. Include issue/PR/external contributor references where applicable
5. Add any changes from the previous step
6. Add the go version message
7. Write the changelog to `changelog/<VERSION>` (e.g. `changelog/1.4`)

No need to include each and every commit, if one commit is only a small fix or a follow up of another one include only the primary feature/bug.
No need to tag maintainers (@camathieu and @bodji)

For example:

```
New :
 - MCP server for AI assistant integration

Documentation :
 - Add MCP upload example screenshot
```

No need to include `Add MCP upload example screenshot` unless it comes from an external contributor

**⏸️ Present the changelog to the user for review. They may want to edit it. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.**

### 6. Update the Helm chart changelog

Open `charts/plik/CHANGELOG.md`. Move all content under `[Unreleased]` into a new `[<VERSION>]` heading, and leave `[Unreleased]` empty for future changes:

```diff
 ## [Unreleased]
-
-### Changed
-- item that was unreleased

+## [<VERSION>]
+
+### Changed
+- item that was unreleased
```

If there are no unreleased changes, add a version heading with a note like:
```markdown
## [<VERSION>]

No Helm chart changes in this release.
```

**⏸️ Present the updated Helm CHANGELOG to the user for review. Wait for explicit approval.**

### 7. Update README.md (stable releases only)

**Skip this step entirely for RC releases.**

For stable releases, update the version references in `README.md`:
- The `wget` download URL in the Quick Start section
- The `tar xzvf` command
- The `cd` command
- Any other version-specific references

Search for the previous stable version string and replace with the new version.

**⏸️ Present the README diff to the user for review. Wait for explicit approval.**

### 8. Create the release commit

Stage all changes:
```bash
git add changelog/<VERSION>
git add charts/plik/CHANGELOG.md
git add README.md  # if modified (stable only)
# any other documentation files that were updated
```

Propose a commit message:
```
chore(release): prepare <VERSION>

- Add changelog/<VERSION>
- Update Helm chart CHANGELOG
- Update README.md version references  # if applicable
- Update documentation  # if applicable
```

**⏸️ Present the commit message to the user. Do NOT commit without explicit approval.**

### 9. Create the pull request

1. Create a branch (if not already on one):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/<VERSION>
   ```
2. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin release/<VERSION>
   ```
3. Draft a PR targeting `master`:
   - **Title**: `chore(release): prepare <VERSION>`
   - **Body**: Include the change made (Changelog, Chart, Readme, Docs,...)

**⏸️ Present the PR draft to the user. Do NOT create the PR on GitHub without explicit approval.**

### 10. Create the GitHub release

After the PR is merged, create the GitHub release. This creates the tag and the release in a single operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `release.yaml` GitHub Actions workflow triggers on `release: created`. Creating the release is what kicks off the CI build — it builds release archives, Docker images, packages the Helm chart, and uploads all artifacts to this release. Make sure the PR is merged to `master` first so the tag points to the right commit.

Use the GitHub MCP tools or GH CLI to create a release:
- **Tag**: `<VERSION>` (targeting `master`)
- **Title**: `Plik <VERSION>`
- **Body**: Use the same content as `changelog/<VERSION>`
- **Pre-release**: `true` if RC, `false` if stable
- **Latest**: `true` only if this is a stable release

**⏸️ Present the full release content to the user. Do NOT create the GitHub release without explicit approval.**

### 11. Post-Release Checklist

After the release is published:

- [ ] **Wait for CI** — watch the GitHub Actions `release` workflow until it completes successfully
- [ ] **Pull Docker image** and verify tags exist and point to the right image:
  ```bash
  docker pull rootgg/plik:<VERSION>
  docker pull rootgg/plik:preview          # all releases
  docker pull rootgg/plik:latest           # stable releases only
  ```
- [ ] **Smoke-test the image** — start the server and verify `/version`:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080 --name plik-release-check rootgg/plik:<VERSION>
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/version | jq .
  ```
  Verify the JSON response:
  - `version` = `<VERSION>`
  - `isRelease` = `true`
  - `isMint` = `true`
  - `goVersion` = expected Go version (e.g. `go1.26.0 linux/amd64`)
  - `clients` array is populated (13 entries: bash, darwin, freebsd, linux, openbsd, windows)
  - `releases` array includes the new version as the last entry
- [ ] **Test client download** — while the container is still running, download a client binary from it:
  ```bash
  curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8080/clients/linux-amd64/plik -o /dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
  docker stop plik-release-check
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Helm repo** — check that the chart index on `gh-pages` includes the new version:
  ```bash
  curl -s https://root-gg.github.io/plik/index.yaml | grep <VERSION>
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Debian packages** — boot a Debian container and test APT repo setup + package install:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm debian:bookworm bash -c '
    set -e
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl gnupg
    curl -fsSL https://root-gg.github.io/plik/apt/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/plik.gpg
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/plik.gpg] https://root-gg.github.io/plik/apt stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plik.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y plik-server plik-client
    echo "--- Verify versions ---"
    plik --version
    plik-server --version
    echo "--- Verify installed files ---"
    dpkg -L plik-server | head -20
    dpkg -L plik-client
    echo "--- Verify systemd unit ---"
    test -f /lib/systemd/system/plik-server.service && echo "systemd unit: OK" || echo "systemd unit: MISSING"
    echo "--- All checks passed ---"
  '
  ```
  Verify:
  - Both packages install without errors
  - `plik --version` and `plik-server --version` output `<VERSION>`
  - The systemd service unit is installed
- [ ] **Verify GitHub release page** — check that the changelog and release artifacts (archives + Helm chart `.tgz` + `.deb` files) are attached

## Important Notes

- **Never push tags, create PRs, or publish releases without explicit user approval** — this is a hard rule
- **RC releases** do NOT update `README.md` and do NOT get the `latest` Docker tag
- **Stable releases** update `README.md` and get the `latest` Docker tag
- The Helm chart `Chart.yaml` uses `__VERSION__` placeholders — do NOT replace them manually; `helm_release.sh` handles this at build time
- The `release.yaml` workflow handles the actual build, Docker push, Helm packaging, and artifact upload — this workflow only prepares the release metadata
